                        Here, weebs from USCâ€™s 23 schools come together to throwdown over just about anything 
                        that deals with the animation and culture of Japan! <br> We have weekly meetings every Thursday (and maybe Saturday)
                        at a semesterly determined location, and <br> communicate through our community discord which can 
                        be found <a href="https://discord.gg/jpSf8z37" target="_blank">here</a>!

                    <p>
                        Historically, our club is known on a greater scale as "Cal Animage Mu," originating from our 
                        affiliation with the network of collegiate anime clubs called "Cal Animage". <br> Starting with Cal Animage Alpha (UC Berkley, circa 1989), this 
                        network loosely ties together many schools over the Pacific Ocean with a predominance in the U.S. state of California, <br> whose students have an 
                        affinity for Japanese animation and culture, serving these collegiate communities by bringing together unique <br> media and individuals 
                        unlike any other. With the "Mu" meaning the 12th of the 15 members, TAC appreciates this rich history and has vowed to 
                        maintain its legacy since 1993!
