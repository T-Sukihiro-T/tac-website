        <h2><b> Welcome to Trojan Anime Culture at the University of Southern California! </b></h2>

        <p>

            Here, weebs from USCâ€™s 23 schools come together to throwdown over just about anything 
            that deals with the animation and culture of Japan! We have weekly meetings every Thursday 
            at a semesterly determined location, and communicate through our community discord which can 
            be found <a href="https://discord.gg/jpSf8z37" target="_blank">here</a>! 

        </p>

        <p>
            Please join us as we are open to all who love anime and enjoy its fanfare, wherein we strive 
            for inclusivity and anti-bias amongst our members. 
        </p>

        <p>
            With all that being said, thank you so much 
            for finding us and always remember: FIGHT ON!
        </p>
