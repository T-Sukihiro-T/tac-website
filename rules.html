                        Here are some pretty simple and easy ground rules that we 
                        follow during meetinsgs, not only to preserve good citizenship
                        and respect for others, but also to once again: NOT SCARE THE WOMEN AWAY!

                    If you have any grievences or concerns with the rules as of now, first think 
                    about why you may have grievences with them and why those grievences may be why
                    the rules are in place, THEN report said grievences to an Eboard memeber if you 
                    feel the need to voice your opinion!

                    <p class="section-text">
                        Fanservice is incredibly common in anime, and a lot of it can be awkwardly outdated, 
                        to put it kindly. We want to make sure nobody feels excluded or uncomfortable, but also recognize 
                        that banning shows with this kind of fanservice would mean banning a good majority of older shows, 
                        including many incredibly iconic mainstream shows. So instead, we will be requiring that requesters 
                        add a warning when requesting a show or episode where such scenes appear. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some examples of scenes that need to come with a fanservice warning is Naruto’s Sexy Jutsu, Kill La Kill scenes where Ryuko 
                        is felt up, and Soul Eater fanservice scenes. A really good rule of thumb is if it can be reasonably 
                        considered sexual assault (even if framed in a comedic way), you need to put a warning. If these scenes 
                        happen often, you may want to consider not bringing it to club at all. If in doubt, ask the officers 
                        and we’ll help you!

                        Violence is usually inevitable in anime, and two goons are inevitably gonna get in the fight, but when it comes to actual physical damage, extremely graphic gore will not be allowed, but mild gore is still allowed.

                        <br>
                        For example: Naruto and Sasuke blowing each other’s arms off during their boyfriend fight is fine, but Lucy slaughtering guards and innocent civilians by slicing them up with her demon invisible hands is not allowed.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        To keep the anime club friendly for all audiences, we dictate that a bikini/underwear is the most a character is allowed to be nude, in other words, panties shots are fine (unless clothing integrity is compromised), and any nudity scenes involving God’s Glorious Rays or Magical Mist used for fanservice purposes is not allowed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example: Getting an eyeful of Hanekawa’s panties at the start of Bakemonogatari is fine, Rudeus contemplating about what he should do while essentially nude in his mental domain is fine. Holo being stark naked during the first episode of Spice and Wolf is fine. The bath scene in Azur Lane where multiple girls are talking about sensitive topics and nudity is used for clearly fanservice purposes is NOT fine.

                        TAC does not support the use of substances in a manner that puts oneself and others in danger. However, since we are all respectable young adults and old teenagers, anime involving the use of basic-level drugs, such as tobacco and alcohol is allowed. Harder and more dangerous drug use should be approached with caution.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example: Characters having a casual smoke or a drink at the bar is fine, and certain characters getting zooted for a good time is also allowed. At more extreme ends, David’s use of anti-cyberpsychosis drugs during Cyberpunk Edgerunners is fine. Certain forms of substance abuse, such as violence spurred on by alcoholism, should be approached with caution, and if you aren’t sure, ask one of us officers if you have doubts

                        As long as it’s done offscreen, it’s fine and fair game. If it is done on screen, that’s called hentai and of course we ain’t gonna play it (even if the parts are hidden and the characters are fully clothed). Suggestive scenes should also be avoided whenever possible. So the Nisemonogatari Toothbrush Scene will not be allowed.

                        Admittedly, it is incredibly hard to define what anime you can and can’t watch, because exceptions inevitably will come up. At the end of the day, if you aren’t sure about an anime, ask us, and we will check if its all clear at the end of the day.

                        And if you want a TLDR for all of this: No hentai, no gore. Capisce? Capisce.
