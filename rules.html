        <b>Thursday Pitching Rules:</b> <br>
        
        <ul><b>
            Since most of the world’s media follows the same criteria for 5 categories, our rules 
            for what can and cannot be pitched at Thursday meetings will be the same. 
        </b></ul>

        <ol> 
            <li> <b>Fanservice in General</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fanservice is incredibly common in anime, and a lot of it can be awkwardly outdated, to put 
                        it kindly. We want to make sure nobody feels excluded or uncomfortable, but also 
                        recognize that banning shows with this kind of fanservice would mean banning a good majority 
                        of older shows, including many incredibly iconic mainstream shows. So instead, we will be 
                        requiring that requesters add a warning when requesting a show or episode where such 
                        scenes appear. Some examples of scenes that need to come with a fanservice warning is Naruto’s 
                        Sexy Jutsu, Kill La Kill scenes where Ryuko is felt up, and Soul Eater fanservice scenes. A really 
                        good rule of thumb is if it can be reasonably considered sexual assault (even if framed in a 
                        comedic way), you need to put a warning. If these scenes happen often, you may want to consider 
                        not bringing it to club at all. If in doubt, ask the officers and we’ll help you! 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li> <b>Violence and Gore</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Violence is usually inevitable in anime, and two goons are inevitably gonna get in the fight, but 
                        when it comes to actual physical damage, extremely graphic gore will not be allowed, but mild gore 
                        is still allowed.
                        <br> <br>
                        For example: Naruto and Sasuke blowing each other’s arms off during their boyfriend fight is 
                        fine, but Lucy slaughtering guards and innocent civilians by slicing them up with her demon 
                        invisible hands is not allowed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li> <b>Nudity</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To keep the anime club friendly for all audiences, we dictate that a bikini/underwear is the most 
                        a character is allowed to be nude, in other words, panties shots are fine (unless clothing integrity 
                        is compromised), and any nudity scenes involving God’s Glorious Rays or Magical Mist  used for 
                        fanservice purposes is not allowed. 
                        <br> <br>
                        For example: Getting an eyeful of Hanekawa’s panties at the start of Bakemonogatari is fine, Rudeus 
                        contemplating about what he should do while essentially nude in his mental domain is fine. 
                        Holo being stark naked during the first episode of Spice and Wolf is fine. The bath scene in Azur 
                        Lane where multiple girls are talking about sensitive topics and nudity is used for clearly 
                        fanservice purposes is NOT fine. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li> <b>Drugs and Substances</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        TAC does not support the use of substances in a manner that puts oneself and others in danger. 
                        However, since we are all respectable young adults and old teenagers, anime involving the use of 
                        basic-level drugs, such as tobacco and alcohol is allowed. Harder and more dangerous drug use 
                        should be approached with caution. 
                        <br> <br>
                        For example: Characters having a casual smoke or a drink at the bar is fine, and certain characters 
                        getting zooted for a good time is also allowed. At more extreme ends, David’s use of 
                        anti-cyberpsychosis drugs during Cyberpunk Edgerunners is fine. Certain forms of substance abuse, such 
                        as violence spurred on by alcoholism, should be approached with caution, and if you aren’t sure, ask 
                        one of us officers if you have doubts
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li> <b>Profanity and Language</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No slurs. We don’t tolerate discrimination such as homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and racism. 
                        Everything else is fair game. Simple? Simple.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br> 
            <li> <b>Sex</b> <br> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As long as it’s done offscreen, it’s fine and fair game. If it is done on screen, that’s called 
                        hentai and of course we ain’t gonna play it (even if the parts are hidden and the characters are 
                        fully clothed). Suggestive scenes should also be avoided whenever possible. So the Nisemonogatari 
                        Toothbrush Scene will not be allowed. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Admittedly, it is incredibly hard to define what anime you can and can’t watch, because exceptions 
                        inevitably will come up. At the end of the day, if you aren’t sure about an anime, ask us, and we 
                        will check if its all clear at the end of the day. 
                        <br> <br>
                        And if you want a TLDR for all of this: No hentai, no gore. Capisce? Capisce.
