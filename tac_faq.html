                        Anime Club, Trojan Alcohol Culture, Trojan Axing Company, Trojan Automobile Culture, Trojan Anl Cndoms, Trojan *hegao Culture, 
                        and Trojans Actually Crying.

                        We are, believe it or not, an anime club. We watch anime, garbage, „Ç¥„Éü, and the occasional good show.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For Thursdays, we do a more general meeting where we pick a specific theme for the week (ex. idol, action, horror) 
                        and have our members pitch anime based on that theme. We divide the pool in two categories based on years, with one 
                        category covering recent anime and the other category covering everything before that. We then choose two anime 
                        (one from each category) by popular vote, and, in addition to those two anime, officers will show a third "feature" 
                        anime of their choosing. After that, we'll have a game of some sort, such as Pictionary or anime music trivia.

                        As of right now, 8-10 PM on Thursday Evenings. Location depends on the semester, but you can usually find 
                        it when the secretary makes the announcement for the week in ‚Å†announcements.

                        in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/307335012703797249/753353725371744256" target="_blank">the thursday requests chat</a>. One thing: make

                        Absolutely. Once a semester we'll have trips to Little Tokyo, Round 1 Japanese Arcade, and EOS club dinner. 
                        We'll also (probably) add on trips as the semester goes on and we see how things turn out. We'll send out 
                        announcements about those in <a href=" https://discord.com/channels/307335012703797249/832890776085987378" target="_blank">the announcements chat</a>.
